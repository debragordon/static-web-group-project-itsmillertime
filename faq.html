               <div><strong>A: </strong>Our sessions happen at all hours of the day.  Typically the singers like to have a certain atmosphere to make their best work; although, exceptions are made.

            <input id="question_2" type="checkbox">
            <div><strong>A: </strong>I have been doing this a long time and I know how involved in the crafting of the song you have already been as the creator of the melody and lyrics.  It is difficult to release your music and trust a producer, but that is what I ask of you.  As a songwriter myself, I know how hard it is to do this.  In most cases you will have to trust me to deliver a quality end result, however you can to some degree you can select what instruments are featured on your music (ie: fiddle, banjo, keys, etc.).</div>

            <input id="question_3" type="checkbox">
            <div><strong>A: </strong>Not counting the time emailing and any time spent sending info. via mail.  I spend about 10 hours recording, mixing, and mastering each song, so you can be sure you are getting a quality custom recording. My turnaround time is generally about 2 weeks. </div>

            <div><strong>A: </strong>If you just write lyrics, I will compose a custom melody specifically for your song, for no extra charge. Other demo services may shoe-horn your lyrics into some existing music they have used dozens of times.</div>

            <div><strong>A: </strong>Has I have mentioned, I am a songwriter myself and I know what it takes to craft music.  I am a registered songwriter with BMI and I will never jeopardize my own career and musical practices by pirating any of your music.  I too make a living in the music business and I want songwriters to keep writing so I can keep living my dream of making music.</div>
