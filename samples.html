          demonstrations along with a few comments from our some of our
          fantastic artists:

              I've been a repeat customer of Frank Michels' Demo Service,
              completing several songs for demo and pitching purposes. He has
              worked with me on my scheduling and has the ability to see my
              vision of the finished product, even if I'm unsure of all the
              aspects. His instrumental proficiency with guitar, mandolin,
              banjo, dobro, fiddle...nearly any instrument and genre...takes
              the presentation to the next level. Artists who have recorded my
              songs, as well as publishers, have commented on the quality of my
              demos. I plan to continue using Frank's Nashville Demos and
              highly recommend his services.

            I received a Single Song Contract in the mail today for Redneck R &
            R. I have only signed one SSC in my 6 years of writing, so this
            will be the 2nd. Thank you for your help. I had a real good feeling
            about that song, and for once I was right. In an endeavor that
            seems to be 99% rejection, it's nice to have a victory now and
            then..I hope someone records it. You were very fair with me price wise and I have another song that I am completing and you are the only person that I will consider. Thank you for all of your help and advice. You are truly the best!

            I would like to take just a moment to express my deepest
            appreciation for your wonderful production of my song, " I'm
            Walking Away". I have let everyone listen to my ballad and they all
            commented on the sound production and the excellent voice of the
            vocalist. I never expected you to complete such a wonderful product
            in less than a week. I wish you success in the future and if I know
            anyone in the industry looking for an excellent production company
            you will be the first and only person I will recommend. Thank you sir!!
