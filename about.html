    <h1>About Frank</h1>
      <h2>I am a multi-instrumentalist who has spent the last 25 years performing with such country stars as Brenda Lee, Tanya Tucker, Deborah Allen, Ronnie McDowell, and currently, Michelle Wright. I play guitar, fiddle, mandolin, banjo, dobro, bass, sampled drums and some keyboards. I now operate a song demo business in Nashville, Tennessee specializing in good quality, reasonably priced recordings.</h2>
      <h3>As a songwriter, this allows me to record my own songs at home, playing all the parts myself. And over the past five years, I have recorded over 1,000 songs for other songwriters who need a great sounding demo, but have limited funds.</h3>
      <p>Most folks who want a "demonstration" recording of their songs think they only have two options: an $800 a song demo cut with great musicians in a top studio, or a cut-rate demo mill session where club players hurry through ten songs an hour. Now there is a third choice.</p>
      <p>My demos include your choice of either a male or female professional Nashville demo singer (learn more about them below). You can choose what instruments you want on your song, or just leave it to me. I spend about 10 hours recording, mixing, and mastering each song, so you can be sure you are getting a quality custom recording.</p>
