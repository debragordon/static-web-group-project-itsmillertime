      <h1>About The Producer</h1>
        <h3 class="main-info">Frank Michels is a multi-instrumentalist who has spent the last 25 years performing with such country stars as Brenda Lee, Tanya Tucker, Deborah Allen, Ronnie McDowell, and currently, Michelle Wright. </h3>
        <h4 class="main-info">He plays guitar, fiddle, mandolin, banjo, dobro, bass, sampled drums and some keyboards. He now operates a song demo business in Nashville, Tennessee specializing in good quality, reasonably priced recordings.As a songwriter, this allows Frank to record his own songs at home, playing all the parts himself. And over the past five years, he has recorded over 1,000 songs for other songwriters who need a great sounding demo, but have limited funds.</h4>
        <p class="main-info">Most folks who want a "demonstration" recording of their songs think they only have two options: an $800 a song demo cut with great musicians in a top studio, or a cut-rate demo mill session where club players hurry through ten songs an hour. Now there is a third choice. Demos made at Frank Michels Nashville Song Demos include your choice of either a male or female professional Nashville demo singer (learn more about them below). You can choose what instruments you want on your song, or just leave it to Frank. He spends about 10 hours recording, mixing, and mastering each song, so you can be sure you are getting a quality custom recording.</p>
