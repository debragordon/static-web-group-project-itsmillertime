          With 25 years within the music industry, I have dedicated myself to
          provide quality demonstrations that are both unique and reasonably
          priced to people all over the world. Nothing makes me happier than to
          hear solid feedback from my customers. Here are some samples of my
          demonstrations along with a few comments from our some of our
          fantastic artists:

            I've been a repeat customer of Frank Michels' Demo Service,
            completing several songs for demo and pitching purposes. He has
            worked with me on my scheduling and has the ability to see my
            vision of the finished product, even if I'm unsure of all the
            aspects. His instrumental proficiency with guitar, mandolin, banjo,
            dobro, fiddle...nearly any instrument and genre...takes the
            presentation to the next level. Artists who have recorded my songs,
            as well as publishers, have commented on the quality of my demos. I
            plan to continue using Frank's Nashville Demos and highly recommend
            his services.

          I received a Single Song Contract in the mail today for Redneck R &
          R. I have only signed one SSC in my 6 years of writing, so this will
          be the 2nd. Thank you for your help. I had a real good feeling
          about that song, and for once I was right. In an endeavor that seems
          to be 99% rejection, it's nice to have a victory now and then..I
          hope someone records it."

        <p>
          I would like to take just a moment to express my deepest appreciation
          for your wonderful production of my song, " I'm Walking Away". I have
          let everyone listen to my ballad and they all commented on the sound
          production and the excellent voice of the vocalist. I never expected
          you to complete such a wonderful product in less than a week. You
          were very fair with me price wise and I have another song that I am
          completing and you are the only person that I will consider. I wish
          you success in the future and if I know anyone in the industry
          looking for an excellent production company you will be the first and
          only person I will recommend.
        </p>
